# Nuxt UI Timepicker

A beautiful time picker for Nuxt 3 apps using [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com) and [Culori](https://culorijs.org).

## ‚ú® Features

This module consists of three nuxt-ui based components for getting a reusable TimePicker:

- `TimePicker.vue`: A button-icon with popup-based time picker with emitting and receiving an hourMinute object: {hour: number, minute: number}
- `InputTimePicker.vue`: Input field with time string in v-model (`HH:MM`)
- `ClockDial.vue`: Reusable clock dial canvas (used internally by TimePicker and InputTimePicker) - can be used for making your own version of a TimePicker
- culori is used to get the primary color from the nuxt-ui settings.
- Fully styled with Nuxt UI components
- Supports dark mode

## Inspired by a jquery plugin

I did a remake a MIT licensed jquery plugin, it inspired me for the visuals but I made the controller from zero in a vue/nuxt/nuxt-ui style: [Clock Timepicker Plugin for jQuery](https://github.com/loebi-ch/jquery-clock-timepicker)

## Contributing

This module is made with nuxt-ui components, but not as part of @nuxt/ui. It is not made using tailwind-variants. But the ClockDial.vue part can be used for making your own version of a TimePicker using tailwind-variants and then be incorporated in @nuxt/ui. 

The timepicker can also be refactored to whatever tailwindcss based timepicker. It will be a joy for me to see parts of this code‚Äîespecially ClockDial.vue‚Äîbeing reused in other timepickers! Be creative!
